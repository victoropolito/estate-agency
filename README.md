# Goal

The purpose of this project is to practice basic concepts of HTML + CSS and create a stylized web page that displays lists. We will have an HTML file that will contain the structure of the real estate page and a CSS file that will contain the styles to change the appearance of the page.

When creating this project, the following concepts were put into practice:

<ul>
  <li>Basic HTML tags</li>
  <li>HTML meta tags</li>
  <li>Lists in HTML</li>
  <li>CSS Selectors</li>
</ul>
